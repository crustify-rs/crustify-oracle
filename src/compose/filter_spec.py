"""Shared CLI-narrowing filter for composer + redo precursors.

Carries the full set of CLI-level analyze flags in one bundle so the
composer, agent, and redo precursors all share the same semantics.

## Fields

  - **`dirs` / `files` / `names`** — seed selectors. An entry is a
    *seed* when it matches at least one of these (union semantics).
    Seed mode is active iff any of these is non-empty.
  - **`scope_json_path`** — optional path to a `in-memory inventory` enabling
    port/wrap classification + the seed admission gate. When
    `None`, the composer treats every entry as import-section (base
    analysis only — no port additions, no closure expansion).
  - **`port_only` / `wrap_only`** — mutually exclusive post-emission
    filters. After the seed/closure logic runs, keep only entries
    that emitted with port additions (`port_only`) or only those
    that emitted as wrap-shape (`wrap_only`).

## Behaviour grid

| in-memory inventory passed? | Effect on seeds and closure |
|---|---|
| **No** (default) | No port/wrap split. Every entry is wrap-shape (base only). No closure expansion. Seeds emit only if they pass `--targeted-only`/`--imported-only` (and the wrap_only side admits everything). |
| **Yes** | Port/wrap classification per the in-memory inventory. A seed is admitted iff it's target-section OR wrap-reachable from port code per the in-memory inventory. Port seeds emit with port additions; wrap seeds + closure entries emit as base shape. |

## Why in-memory inventory is optional now

The previous model implicitly read `<target>/.crustify/in-memory inventory`
on every analyze invocation, making "port-aware" the default and
silently enabling a wrap-reach gate that could surprise users
(e.g. `--name SSL_new` emitting nothing because statem doesn't
reach SSL_new). Making `--scope` opt-in surfaces the gate explicitly
in the CLI invocation. Without `--scope`, the composer does no
port-related reasoning at all — the output is purely seed-driven.

`analyze_scope` (a composer-only stage) still
reads the target's `in-memory inventory` implicitly — that command is
defined as "operate on the target's file set," not as
a general query.
